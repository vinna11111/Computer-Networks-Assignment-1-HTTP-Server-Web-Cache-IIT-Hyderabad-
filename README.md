# Computer-Networks-Assignment-1-HTTP-Server-Web-Cache-IIT-Hyderabad-
What I Built & Learned

ðŸ”¹ 1. HTTP Server
	â€¢	Implemented a lightweight HTTP server from scratch.
	â€¢	Supported operations:
	â€¢	GET â†’ Retrieve values
	â€¢	PUT â†’ Insert key-value pairs
	â€¢	DELETE â†’ Remove key-value pairs
	â€¢	Designed a simple key-value store for request handling.
	â€¢	Used pcap traces + Wireshark to verify correct HTTP communication.
	â€¢	Learned how application-layer protocols (HTTP) ride over TCP sockets.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 2. Web Cache
	â€¢	Implemented a proxy cache that sits between client and server.
	â€¢	Key learnings:
	â€¢	Cache Hit â†’ Response served instantly from cache.
	â€¢	Cache Miss â†’ Request forwarded to server, response cached for future.
	â€¢	Observed how caching drastically reduces latency.
	â€¢	Measured and compared end-to-end request timings across scenarios.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Network Measurement & Analysis
	â€¢	Captured pcap traces at client, server, and cache nodes.
	â€¢	Analyzed packet flows in Wireshark to validate protocol correctness.
	â€¢	Compared timings across first, second, and third requests to quantify caching benefits.
	â€¢	Learned how tools like Mininet emulate real-world topologies for reproducible experiments.
